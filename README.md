# Multi-Projects Repository

This repository serves as a collection of multiple data science projects. The goal is to maintain a central location for various projects that involve different topics and methods in data science, machine learning, and web development. As I continue working on new projects, they will be added to this repository.

## Current Projects:
### - Algerian Forest Fires Analysis
This project focuses on predicting the occurrence of forest fires in Algeria using the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset. By analyzing environmental factors, the project explores the occurrence of forest fires and trains several regression models to predict the likelihood of future fires.

### - Holiday Package Analysis/Prediction
This project involves analyzing customer data to provide actionable recommendations for the Policy Maker and Marketing Team. By identifying trends and insights, the analysis supports decision-making processes. Additionally, several machine learning models, including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree, were implemented to build a predictive model for identifying potential customers likely to purchase the newly introduced travel package.

For more details, refer to the specific project folder, which contains the necessary files, code, and instructions.
