# Multi-Projects Repository

This repository serves as a collection of multiple data science projects. The goal is to maintain a central location for various projects that involve different topics and methods in data science, machine learning, and web development. As I continue working on new projects, they will be added to this repository.

## Current Projects:
### - Algerian Forest Fires Analysis
### Overview
Currently, this repository contains a project focused on predicting the occurrence of forest fires in Algeria using various regression models. The **Algerian Forest Fires Dataset** has been used to explore and analyze forest fire occurrences based on different environmental factors, and several machine learning models have been trained to predict the likelihood of fires.

For more details, refer to the specific project folder, which contains the necessary files, code, and instructions.


## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dennis0733/multi-projects-repo.git
    ```

2. Install required dependencies for the project you want:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Navigate to the appropriate project folder to work on or run individual projects.

## Future Projects

As I continue to work on new data science and machine learning projects, this repository will be updated with additional folders for each new project.
